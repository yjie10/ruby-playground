# Objects

- Almost everything in Ruby is an object.
- Similar to physical objects.
- Objects can represent abstract ideas.
- Objects have attributes - e.g. an attribute to a book can include color, title, total pages, etc.
- Objects are instaces of a class. A class is a general type, while an object is a specific instance of that type.
- Objects have behaviors.

# Variables

- The exception in Ruby which are _NOT_ objects.
- Store a reference to an object.
- We can treat variables like objects because once a variable is assigned an object, it acts just like that object.
- _Naming Convention: lowercase with underscores (snake)._

### Variable Scope Indicators

- Global | `$variable`
- Class | `@@variable`
- Instance | `@variable`
- Local | `variable`
- Block | `variable`
  - If it's being used inside a block of code.
