# Nil

# nil is an object in Ruby. 
# if a variable is created but nothing is set for the value, it is nil. 
# P.S. In JS, an empty variable is undefined and an empty object is null. 

nil == false
# false

#  to check if something is nil
nil.nil?

product = nil
product.nil?
product == nil
!product # does this have a value?
